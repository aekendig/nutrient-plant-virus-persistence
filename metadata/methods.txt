Motivation: Ecological theory that predicts the effects of resource availability on species interactions has been explored across a range of systems. Yet, application of this theory to communities of host-associated pathogens has been limited. Host resources and diet can impact disease severity and prevalence, and these resource effects on disease may be mediated by pathogen-pathogen interactions within hosts infected with multiple pathogens. As with free-living organisms, pathogen species can alter each other’s population growth rates, population densities, and transmission to new hosts through facilitative or antagonistic processes. We used a model grass-virus system (Barley and Cereal Yellow Dwarf Viruses in Avena sativa) to test the hypothesis that host nutrition can constrain virus-virus interactions by simultaneously determining both within-host density and transmission to new hosts. 

Design: The experiment consisted of twelve treatments: four host nutrient treatments crossed with three inoculation treatments. Host nutrients were manipulated by watering Avena sativa with one of four modified Hoagland solutions (7.5 μM N and 1 μM P (Low), 7.5 μM N and 50 μM P (P), 375 μM N and 1 μM P (N), or 375 μM N and 50 μM P (N+P)). Watering began two days after planting A. sativa seeds in 164 mL conical pots with 70% Sunshine medium vermiculite (vermiculite and less than 1% crystalline silica; Sun Gro Horticulture) and 30% Turface MVP (calcined clay containing up to 30% crystalline silica; Turface Athletics, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). A. sativa were watered with 30 mL of nutrient solution twice per week prior to inoculation and weekly following inoculation. Inoculation treatments consisted of BYDV-PAV (PAV, hereafter), CYDV-RPV (RPV, hereafter), or both. Plants were inoculated ten to eleven days post planting using ten aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi) per plant (PAV: five aphids carrying PAV, five mock-inoculated; RPV: five carrying RPV, five mock-inoculated; both: five carrying PAV, five carrying RPV). We conducted transmission trials by placing 25 aphids on this first set of plants (i.e., the source plants), allowing them to feed, and transferring five of the aphids to each of four uninfected plants grown in the four nutrient treatments (i.e., the receiving plants). Transmission trials took place when source plants were harvested. Plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 20 degrees C with a 16:8 h light:dark cycle under 28W bulbs. We destructively harvested the source plants at eight different days post inoculation (DPI): 5, 8, 12, 16, 19, 22, 26, or 29 days. We stored approximately 60% of the source plant tissue at -80 degrees C and used the rest for the transmission trials. The receiving plants were harvested 14-15 DPI and all of the stem and leaf tissue was stored at -80 degrees C. The experiment was performed over five temporal blocks with one to two treatment-by-harvesting day replicates (n = 96) per block.

Plant Measurements: At each harvesting day, we measured chlorophyll three times along the largest leaf on each plant using a SPAD-502 (Konica Minolta, Tokyo, Japan). Then, we split the plants into shoots (stem and leaves) and roots by dividing them at the highest roots. We weighed the aboveground tissue immediately, and the belowground tissue after rinsing with tap water and drying on paper towels. Stems and leaves were scanned (Seiko Epson Crop, Suwa, Japan) and analyzed for area and perimeter with ImageJ software (Rasband 2014).

Virus Density: To quantify virus density (number of viruses per mg plant) in source plants, we first thawed approximately 50 mg of haphazardly chosen cut plant tissue from the portion stored at -80 degrees C. We extracted total RNA from the plant tissue following the manufacturer’s instructions for TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). We divided the RNA extract into three technical replicates and used one-step reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to obtain estimates of the number of copies of PAV and RPV RNA within each sample. We used the RNA-to-CT 1-Step Kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific), primers, probes, and standards designed for PAV and RPV, and the Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-time PCR System. To estimate the density of PAV or RPV in a plant, we took the mean of the concentration (copies/ul) in the technical replicates (wells), calculated the copies in the 50 ul of total RNA extract, and then divided it by the mass of plant tissue used for the RNA extraction. Some of the samples were also analyzed with reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction, and gel electrophoresis following the methods presented by Lacroix et al. (2014) in order to screen for accidental infections.

Virus Transmission: To test the transmission success of receiving plants, we first extracted the total RNA following the methods described in Virus Density. We then followed the methods presented by Lacroix et al. (2014) for reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction, and gel electrophoresis.

Analysis Decisions: We excluded standards from analysis if they had a lower density than any detected negative controls (i.e., water; indicating a potential false positive). Samples in runs with standard curves outside the target efficiency range (85% - 115%) were re-analyzed when possible but excluded in analyses otherwise. We removed technical replicates that were detected, but outside of the standard curve. Non-detected technical replicates were included in the mean as zero density and non-detected samples (i.e. all replicates were not detected) were included in the analysis of infection rate, but not virus density. Only source plants with quantified virus densities corresponding to their inoculation treatment were used in the analysis of transmission. Plants with accidental infections (i.e. PAV detected in RPV-inoculated plants and RPV detected in PAV-inoculated plants) were included in analyses as singly infected plants because the timing of the accidental infection was unknown. Such infections may have been caused by small aphids that escaped inoculation cages (no other insects were observed on the experimental plants).

Analysis: We performed all statistical analyses in R version 3.5.2. To analyze the effects of nutrient addition and coinfection on virus density in source plants, the infection rate of source plants, and transmission to receiving plants, we fit Bayesian generalized linear models to data for each virus species using the brms package (Bürkner 2017). Virus density was modeled with a Gaussian distribution and formatted as ln(density) ~ coinfection * N addition * P addition, where coinfection, N addition, and P addition were binary variables (0 or 1, applies to all other models). Harvesting day was included as a first-order autocorrelation structure (cor_ar function). Source plant infection was modeled with a Bernoulli distribution (logit-link) and formatted as infection ~ coinfection * N addition * P addition. Harvesting day was included as a random effect because autocorrelation structures were not compatible with this family of models. Transmission was also modeled with a Bernoulli distribution (logit-link) and formatted as transmission ~ density + coinfection * (Nsource * Psource + Nreceiving * Preceiving), where the subscripts indicate which plant the nutrient treatment was applied to, and density was centered and scaled. Harvesting day and experimental block were included as crossed random effects. We used data from a previous experiment that measured PAV and RPV densities and transmission under almost identical laboratory conditions to inform the priors for the density and transmission models (Lacroix et al. 2017). All models were run with three Markov chains, 6000 iterations each with a 1000 iteration warm-up. We used r-hat values, visualizations of chain convergence, and visual comparisons of the observed data and simulated data from the posterior predictive distributions to evaluate model fit. All packages and versions are reported in the code.
