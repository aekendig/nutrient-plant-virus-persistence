This data package includes data and code from an experiment testing the effects of nitrogen and phosphorus addition on interactions between two grass viruses (BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV). Data include virus density within oats (Avena sativa) and transmission of viruses to a second set of oats. Data were collected by Amy E. Kendig and collaborators between February 2014 and August 2014 at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul Minnesota, USA. Experiments were performed in growth chambers, virus density data were obtained using one-step reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and transmission data were obtained using RT-PCR. The code includes statistical analyses and figures. Model objects created through statistical analyses are also included. The code was run using R (version 3.5.2).
