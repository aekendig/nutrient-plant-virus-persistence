attributeName	attributeDefinition	class	unit	dateTimeFormatString	missingValueCode	missingValueCodeExplanation
well	position of sample in 96-well plate	character				
sample	ID assigned to sample	categorical				
target	virus species being targeted for qPCR	categorical				
task	purpose of the sample	categorical				
reporter	fluorescent dye probe used to detect amplification	categorical				
quencher	molecule attached to the 3' end of the probes to prevent the reporter from emitting signal while the probe is still intact	categorical				
cycle	PCR cycle at which the fluorescence meets the threshold in the amplification plot (lower concentration samples take longer and have higher cycle numbers)	numeric	dimensionless		Undetermined	
cycle_mean	the mean of the cycles associated with a single sample-target combination	numeric	dimensionless		"NA"	
cycle_sd	the standard deviation of the cycles associated with a single sample-target combination	numeric	dimensionless		"NA"	
quantity	the automatically estimated amount of target in the well, based on cycle and standard curve	numeric	dimensionless		"NA"	
quantity_mean	the mean of the quantities associated with a single sample-target combination	numeric	dimensionless		"NA"	
quantity_sd	the standard deviation of the quantities associated with a single sample-target combination	numeric	dimensionless		"NA"	
auto_threshold	indicator variable for whether or not the threshold was set automatically	categorical				
threshold	the level of fluorescence above the baseline and within the exponential amplification region	numeric	dimensionless			
auto_baseline	indicator variable for whether or not the baseline was set automatically	categorical				
baseline_start	the lower end of the cycle range that defines background fluorescence	numeric	dimensionless			
baseline_end	the upper end of the cycle range that defines background fluorescence	numeric	dimensionless			
comments	comments entered during qPCR analysis	categorical			"NA"	
high_sd	indicator that the cycle_sd value is high relative to a predetermined threshold	categorical				
no_amp	indicator that the sample did not amplify (no fluorescence detected at or above the threshold)	categorical				
outlier_rg	indicator that the well cycle has a large deviation from other replicate wells in the same sample-target combination (outlier in replicate group)	categorical				
exp_fail	indicator that the automatic algorithm failed for the well (exponential algorithm failed)	categorical
